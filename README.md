npm is used to do package management. It is like Maven
	- npm init
	- npm install jquery
	- Packages are downloaded to a folder named node-modules
	- If node-modules is deleted, simply run npm-install again
	
Installation :

- Download zip from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and configure path variable in windows
- npm -v (To verify)
